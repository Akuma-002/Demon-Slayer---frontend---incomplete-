<ul>
<li>The Twelve Kizuki is an organization of the 12 strongest beings amongst demon-kind, second in strength and authority only to the Demon King himself, Muzan Kibutsuji.
Each member of the Twelve Kizuki has received a large portion of Muzan's blood, greater than any other demon, thus exponentially increasing their power.
As a testament to this, every member of the Twelve Kizuki can use Blood Demon Arts, supernatural powers and techniques manifested through their blood that only significantly powerful 
demons have access to.
</li>
<li>While the exact relationships between the two groups are unclear, it is known that the <a href="Upper Ranks.html"><b>Upper Ranks</b></a> despise the <a href="Lower Ranks.html"><b>Lower Ranks</b></a></li>
<li>The <a href="Upper Ranks.html"><b>Upper Ranks</b></a> each possesses a level of power that far surpasses that of the <a href="Lower Ranks.html"><b>Lower Ranks</b></a>; 
 as proof of their strength, the strongest of the Demon Slayer Corps, the Hashira, have killed numerous <a href="Lower Ranks.html"><b>Lower Ranks</b></a> over the years, 
while the <a href="Upper Ranks.html"><b>Upper Ranks</b></a> have killed and eaten many Hashira.
Kagaya Ubuyashiki states that it had been a hundred years since an Upper Rank has been killed following the defeat of Gyutaro and Daki.
Furthermore, it has been remarked by Shinobu Kocho that the strength of an Upper Rank demon is, at least, comparable to three Hashira,
although it should be noted that the capabilities of a Hashira vary from one to another, 
especially the ones who can manifest their Demon Slayer Mark to further augment their strength. 
While the <a href="Lower Ranks.html"><b>Lower Ranks</b></a> have been replaced countless times, the <a href="Upper Ranks.html"><b>Upper Ranks</b></a> did not change over 100 years at all.
</li>
<li>When a member of the group is removed from the Twelve Kizuki, Muzan Kibutsuji demotes these members by slashing the pupils where the 
number signifying their rank is located, creating an "X" shaped scar over the digit, signifying that they are no longer part of the Twelve Kizuki.
The only example of this happening is Kyogai, who had already reached his "limit" and could no longer consume human flesh. 
This gradually led to Kyogai losing his appetite for humans and beginning to lose the ability to evolve and become stronger.
Therefore, he was deemed too weak to remain in his position of Lower Rank Six and subsequently removed.
</b>
</li>
<li>After their most recent failure with the death of Rui, holder of Lower Rank Five, Muzan decided to dismantle the <a href="Lower Ranks.html"><b>Lower Ranks</b></a> completely. 
He ordered Nakime to summon each member to the Infinity Castle and proceeded to kill all of the <a href="Lower Ranks.html"><b>Lower Ranks</b></a>, 
sparing only Enmu, Lower Rank One, and giving him a chance to redeem himself by killing a Hashira and bringing him the head of Tanjiro Kamado.
With Enmu's death at the hands of Tanjiro, the <a href="Lower Ranks.html"><b>Lower Ranks</b></a> are functionally disbanded with all of their members dead,
and with Nakime's death at the hands of Muzan himself, the <a href="Upper Ranks.html"><b>Upper Ranks</b></a> are also functionally disbanded with all their members dead.
</li>

            <h2><u>Mission</u></h2>
            <P><big>
                                <b>The Twelve Kizuki have been given three tasks to complete by Muzan's command:</b>
            <br>
            <ul>
<li>To find the Blue Spider Lily, but since Muzan's discovery (via Hantengu) that Nezuko Kamado is immune to the sun, 
he has decided that the <a href="Upper Ranks.html"><b>Upper Ranks</b></a>' first focus is to capture her and bring her to him.</li>





<li>The destruction of the Demon Slayer Corps. 
As part of their Mission to destroy the Corps, Muzan gave the Twelve Kizuki specific orders to hunt down and eliminate the Ubuyashiki Family, 
as they are the Corps’s leaders and backers, 
and are ultimately what keeps the Corps alive and enables them to rebuild the organization again and again no matter how many times Muzan and the Twelve Kizuki try to destroy it.
</li>
<li>After hundreds of years of failing at these two tasks, 
Muzan has decided that the Twelve Kizuki should serve him with suicidal devotion to ensure success.
</li>
            </ul>
            </big></P>



            <h2><u>Blood Battle</u></h2>
            <p><big>According to Kokushibo, if there is any dissatisfaction between the say members of the Upper Rank demons, 
the lower ranked challenger must invoke the right to kill or defeat their desired target in order to 
change their position in the hierarchy. Any that defies the rules will face retribution, 
as seen when Akaza attacked Doma who was a higher rank than him--the former had his arm sliced off by Kokushibo 
as a warning for disregarding the hierarchical order.
</big></p>
<h2><u>Privileges</u></h2>
<p><big><ul>
    <li>        As the Twelve Kizuki are deemed by Muzan to be the twelve most powerful demons (second only to himself), 
        he is known to constantly give favour and special attention to all twelve members of the group. 
        As seen when he would give several of the group's members special privileges normally not given to average demons. 
        One of these privileges is that he would empower all members of the group with huge amounts of his blood in order to increase their 
        power and strength in acknowledgement of their achievements and further strengthen them in order to be of further use in his plans.
    </li>
    <li>        Moreover, Upper Rank demons have the authority to transform humans they view as worthy into demons by giving them 
        blood, and upon receiving permission from Muzan, their blood will transform into his'. 
        This is seen with Gyutaro's and Daki's case where Doma was able to turn the siblings into demons by giving them his blood. 
        This is also seen with Kaigaku, where Kokushibo was also able to turn the Demon Slayer into a demon by giving him his blood.
    </li>
    <li>        As seen from the case with Rui, Muzan himself had given him special permission to form a large group of demons — despite 
        his own law of forbidding them to team up together in large numbers — in order to satisfy his longing for a family. 
        Showcasing that despite his paranoia of the possibility of other demons teaming up together in order to overthrow him, 
        his favouritism for Rui exempted him from immediately executing him and his new "family" and allowing its existence.
    </li>
    <li>        Furthermore, Muzan was shown to have given Gyutaro and Daki the special privilege of sharing the position of Upper Rank Six. 
        His favouritism towards Daki's older brother, Gyutaro, allowed her to also have the rank and share it with him despite her being notably 
        weaker than him and the other <a href="Upper Ranks.html"><b>Upper Ranks</b></a>.
    </li>
    <li>        In the case of Akaza, he was given special permission by Muzan to not eat women. 
        Akaza was noted by Doma to have an unusual aversion to eating or even hurting women despite the immense power he 
        could gain by devouring them due to their stronger nutritional value to a demon's development. 
        Despite his orders for all Twelve Members of the Group to continuously strive for more power by 
        eating humans in mass to be of better use to him, Muzan actually gave Akaza special permission to not eat women and 
        indulged his unusual quirk due to considering him to be one of his favourite <a href="Upper Ranks.html"><b>Upper Ranks</b></a>. 
        Akaza was also noted to be only deployed by Muzan for special assignments and nothing else, further showing the favour he gives him as 
        one of his favourites.
    </li>
</ul></big></p>
<h2>Part</h2>
<p><big>    The Twelve Kizuki are divided into two groups, the six <a href="Upper Ranks.html"><b>Upper Ranks</b></a>, numbered one through six, and the six <a href="Lower Ranks.html"><b>Lower Ranks</b></a>, also numbered one through six. 
    The number signifies their ranking among the Twelve Kizuki, determined by each member's level of strength, 
    Upper Rank One being the strongest and Lower Rank Six being the weakest. The <a href="Lower Ranks.html"><b>Lower Ranks</b></a> have their numbers and ranks engraved 
    only into one eye, whereas the <a href="Upper Ranks.html"><b>Upper Ranks</b></a> have their numbers in one eye and the kanji for "<a href="Upper Ranks.html"><b>Upper Ranks</b></a>" in the other.
