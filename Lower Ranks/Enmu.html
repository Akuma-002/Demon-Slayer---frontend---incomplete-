            Enmu (魘えん夢む Enmu?) was the primary antagonist in the Mugen Train Arc of Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba. He was a demon affiliated with the Twelve Kizuki, holding the position of Lower Rank One (下か弦げんの壱いち Kagen no Ichi?).

                        <p>
                            Enmu was a slender young man who appeared to be in his mid twenties. He possessed a medium build and was of average height. He had ringed blue eyes that tilt sharply down towards the sides of his face, the left one of which had the kanji for "Lower One" etched into its iris, and a horizontal slit on his right instead of a pupil. He had three square-shaped markings on each of his cheeks, each separated by a smaller square, which fade from green to yellow in colour, and straight, chin-length hair of a dark black colour which he wore parted to his right, the right side tucked behind his ear. His hair fades into a red-pink colour near the ends, but appears blue at the tips of the two longer, shoulder-length strands that curve upwards and outwards below the base of his neck, from under the rest of his hair.

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Enmu wore a long, black button-up coat that arched upwards on either side of his legs so that only the two tails in front and behind fall down below his knees, and a white dress shirt, the cuffs of which appear over those of his coat. He also wore a pair of pinstriped pale grey pants and plain, slightly heeled shoes of a similar colour.

                            When Enmu received more blood from Muzan Kibutsuji, his left hand formed a mouth at the back, an eye next to it and most of his fingers had the kanji for Dream (夢ゆめ Yume?) etched on their skin.

                        <p>
                            Enmu was cold, callous, and sadistic, openly stating that he enjoyed the pain and suffering of humans; his favourite method of torment was giving them a happy and pleasant dream before turning it into a nightmare and taking pleasure in the agonized expressions they made as he tortured them. This sadism even extends to his fellow demons, as he relished seeing his fellow Lower Ranks being killed right in front of his eyes.

                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            As well as sadism, Enmu was shown to exhibit masochistic behaviour's, a multitude of times he had expressed positive reactions to pain inflicted on him. This enjoyment, however, seems to be limited to those he only respects and holds himself loyal to, the required power over him mostly being hierarchical rather than literal. This masochism was shown most prominently in the Lower Ranks Meeting, during which, upon being gifted with Muzan's blood, a typically torturous and painful experience that could have potentially killed him, Enmu appeared with a smiling and flushed expression, enjoying the experience. Though, these masochistic tendencies were not prevalent in his battle against the Demon Slayers as when they successfully attacked him, he was seen only being amused, shocked, or frustrated by his failures.
  
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Like most demons, Enmu was shown to have little to no care for human life; he saw humans as nothing more than mere pawns, as he did not bother to warn his human minions of the various dangers of facing Demon Slayers, and simply considered them to be expendable. He also seemed to revel in turning humans into his desperate servants by using his power to give them nice and pleasant dreams, before he pulled them out and falsely promised to give them more if they helped him.
  
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Enmu was also intelligent and cautious in approach to anything he executed, having complete understanding of his power's strengths and weaknesses and making sure to both exploit and avoid them respectively in order to succeed. However, upon being given more blood and therefore further empowered by Muzan, Enmu seemed to have become overconfident, arrogant and greedy, as seen when he acted more recklessly to obtain more blood from Muzan in order to properly challenge one of the Upper Ranks to a blood duel in order to take their place.

                        <p>
                            During his life as a human, he had a tendency since childhood to not be able to distinguish the difference between dreams and reality, and this caused many problems for the people around him. As an adult, he pretended to be a doctor. Under the guise of treatments, he misused procedures like hypnotic therapies, as well as convincing patients who did not have long to live that they had recovered their health. Even when people realized, after some time, that all he was doing was disingenuous, he continued doing his negligent treatment on patients.

                            One night, Muzan encountered and wanted to completely devour Enmu. His intestines were eaten by the demon and he was not supposed to turn into a demon at first, but because he felt no pain from the fatal wound, he envied and praised Muzan. With those last words, his heart and brain stopped working, eventually leading Muzan to turn him into a demon. Enmu knew that he had been transformed by Muzan on a whim and would only remember him in passing, so Enmu did his best to ascend to the rank of Lower Rank One.

                            Following Rui's death at the hands of the Demon Slayers, Enmu was summoned to the Infinity Castle by the Biwa Demon. He was the first to be so; unsure of the situation, he walked around the castle as more of the Lower Ranks were summoned as well. Before long, they are all transported to a platform in front of the Biwa Demon, who is accompanied by an unfamiliar female demon. Strangely, amongst all of them, Enmu was the only one who remained calm, whereas his fellow Lower Ranks grew nervous and tense at the situation.

                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Though they do not recognize the female demon, they are commanded to bow in a familiar voice. The Lower Ranks kneel, realizing the female demon was a disguised Muzan Kibutsuji, who is enraged at their weakness, citing Rui's death as an example of their inability to gain power. He compares them unfavourably to the Upper Ranks, whose positions have not changed in over a hundred years, whilst they continue to die and change ranks due to the Lower Ranks' inability to kill the Hashira.

                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Enmu then hears as Kamanue is devoured by Muzan for questioning his near-impossible expectations, followed by Mukago getting crushed over refuting his claims that they fear the Hashira more than him. Wakuraba then attempts to flee the Infinity Castle whilst Muzan is looking away, a move that Enmu deemed as foolish. The Demon Progenitor decapitates the fleeing demon, before questioning Enmu and Rokuro for their last words. When Rokuro attempts to seek a reprieve and gain his blood to fight for his cause, Muzan only denounces him as shameless for attempting to fulfil a request over his authority, before killing him and leaving Enmu last.

                        </p>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            When Muzan asks for his last words, Enmu raves about the dire situation being a dream come true to him, happy that his death is by his hands and speaking of his enjoyment in watching his fellow demons' final moments of fear and agony. He is then stabbed with a spine from Muzan's arm and injected with a large amount of blood to enhance him. As Enmu writhes in agony, Muzan congratulates him for giving an answer that pleases him, ordering Lower One to make himself useful by successfully killing a Hashira. Muzan then gives him another incentive, promising to give more blood as a reward for killing a Demon Slayer wearing hanafuda earrings, much to Enmu's joy. The Biwa Demon then shifts the castle, manipulating Enmu's position and dropping him into an unknown town, where he then sees a vision of his target thanks to Muzan's blood.

                            Sometime later, Enmu locates a large train and makes use of it as a base. Unbeknownst to him, the train was already reported to have over forty people disappear inside it, resulting in the Demon Slayer Corps dispatching the Flame Hashira to investigate. Soon, the train is then boarded by three more Demon Slayers tasks to accompany him. As the train departs for its journey, Enmu stands atop the locomotive, waiting to strike.

                            Later, Enmu appears standing upon the steam engine, remarking that dying while dreaming is a blessing.[4] While waiting upon the outside of the train, Enmu works on the inside, sending his sentient hand to praise the Train Conductor about the success of putting the Demon Slayers to sleep. In result, Enmu rewards him by also sending him into a presumably deep sleep. The hand then addressed the other conspirators, cautioning them about how to proceed with their plan and of its host's temporary inability to move. Back on top of the train, Enmu's main body joyfully reflects on his plan to destroy his targets' spirit cores to render them completely vulnerable, and of the fragile nature of human hearts and spirits.[5] As his plan begins to unfold, he notes his victims' inability to wake up and stop his twisted scheme.

                    <Li>
                        <p>
                            After an extended period of time passes, Enmu notices that his human pawns were having trouble destroying the spirit cores, but decides that it was alright as they were simply buying time. Shortly thereafter, as he turns to Tanjiro who approaches him, he greets him and taunts that he showed him a pleasant dream, but could have made it a nightmare. Smiling, the Demon further adds that Tanjiro's next dream would be of his father coming back to life.

                        <p>
                            While continuing to tease Tanjiro, Enmu muses over his enjoyment of first showing humans pleasant dreams and then giving them tormenting nightmares, as well as the finer details of his plan. Though somewhere inside his monologue, Enmu also wonders aloud how Tanjiro figured out how to wake himself up and out of his dream so quickly, which causes him to notice the Demon Slayer's earrings, much to his joy. Now targeted on the young Demon Slayer, Enmu's thoughts become solely on receiving more of Muzan's blood and challenging the Upper Ranked Demons with his newfound strength. Enraged, Tanjiro attempts to attack the Lower Rank, but Enmu quickly puts him to sleep. The youth just as fast breaks Enmu's technique despite the Demon's multiple attempts, leading the surprised Lower Rank to compliment his determination. His neck is then severed by the furious Demon Hunter, but an unfazed Enmu merely states that he now knew why his leader wants Tanjiro dead, and reveals to the shocked youth the reason for his continued survival: he had fused with the train while they had all slept. Taunting Tanjiro to protect the two hundred passengers inside of him, Enmu's severed head merges into the train.

                            Thanks to Tanjiro and Inosuke's joint effort, they manage to discover Enmu's neck embedded in the train, and subsequently behead him by completely cutting off the train's top engine compartment. Enmu, in complete disbelief at his failure, begins to desperately curse all the Demon Slayers, Nezuko, and the Upper Ranks due to being inferior to them in power. As his body slowly disintegrates, he attempts to at least kill the weakened Tanjiro and Inosuke but only failed once more as his body began to crumble faster. While he dies, Enmu begins to further desperately curse his failure and frantically think that the entire debacle to be a nightmare, a reference to his childhood trauma, and fearfully demands to have a redo as he finally crumbles to nothing.

                            <b>Overall Abilities:</b> As Lower Rank One, Enmu was the strongest Lower Rank and closest to matching the strength of the Upper Ranks. Upon receiving more blood from Muzan Kibutsuji, his abilities were further enhanced. This level of ability was shown when Enmu's shapeshifting ability evolved to the point he was able fuse with a vehicle as big as a train. Additionally, his unorthodox sleep-based Blood Demon Art enabled him to render over 200 passengers in the Mugen Train, including the likes of the Hashira Kyojuro Rengoku, asleep and almost completely vulnerable. In direct combat, Enmu was able to hold his own against Tanjiro Kamado who had mastered Total Concentration Constant, evading his sword swings with ease and constantly putting the Demon Slayer to sleep with his spells. In his fused form, every single inch of the Mugen Train became his body, which took the combined effort of Tanjiro, Zenitsu, Inosuke, Nezuko and Kyojuro himself to ward off and defeat. Despite all this, Enmu realized after his defeat that he wasn't quite at the level of an Upper Rank demon and he still paled in comparison to the likes of Daki and Gyutaro, the lowest members of the Upper Ranks.

                        <p>
                            <b>Enhanced Speed & Reflexes:</b> As a member of the Twelve Kizuki, Enmu had assimilated a high concentration of Muzan's blood which has greatly improved his physical abilities and attributes, most notably his movement speed and reflexes. This was shown during his initial battle against Tanjiro where he was able to dodge and react to every single one of the Demon Slayer's attacks with little effort, even moving so fast that Tanjiro had trouble keeping up.

                            <b>Flesh Manipulation:</b> Like all demons, Enmu possessed the ability to manipulate his own flesh. However, as a member of the Twelve Kizuki, Enmu's manipulation was at a very high degree; he was able to mix his blood with ink that is almost untraceable, he used his flesh to create rope and bony awls able to enter dreams and cripple his victims, and he was able create tentacles strong enough to fully restrain Nezuko, who was a powerful demon herself. These tentacles also could be formed without limit and would have overwhelmed the Demon Slayers if it had not been for Tanjiro's successful decapitation.

                            <b>Flesh Detachments:</b> Enmu showed the ability to create flesh detachments from his own body, able to create and detach one of his own hands and send it out independent from his main body. Enmu was also able to communicate and see through his hand by utilizing the eye and mouth on it. Later, Enmu was shown to be capable of creating a flesh puppet, in order to fool Tanjiro into thinking that it was his real body.

                        <p><B>Sleep Inducement:</B> Enmu's Blood Demon Art granted him the ability to force anyone into a deep sleep. He can do this through different means, some more subtle than others, but all effectively leaving his foes vulnerable and unable to fight. The slumber induced was very potent and it took considerable effort to wake the victim up, as seen when Nezuko headbutted Tanjiro quite hard but failed to awaken him. However, his state of sleep was not perfect, as Enmu carefully preferred to stay away from Demon Slayers out of fear that his bloodlust could awaken them, although he was far less cautious against normal human targets.

                            <b>Dream Manipulation:</b> Enmu's Blood Demon Art's secondary ability was his power to enter, manipulate and control someone's dreams when they are asleep. When using his technique, his victims experienced joyous dreams normally suited to each person, taking advantage of their vulnerabilities and ensuring they are unable to tell the difference from reality, thus rapidly seducing them to embrace the utopian visions that lay before them. This level of vulnerability made it far easier for Enmu to manipulate his prey, bribing people to do his bidding by giving them happy dreams, which also doubled as a means to perpetuate his own sadistic practices. Just like he can bestow dreams, Enmu was equally capable of forcing nightmares, which he uses both as a psychological attack and a means of torture, something he was particularly fond of when preying on humans. But similarly to his ability to induce sleep, Enmu's dreams, while extremely potent, were not perfect, as one can be capable of resisting its effects through sufficient willpower, which allowed an affected person to realize they are in fact living an illusion. However, realizing they are in a dream is not enough to end the induced sleep, as Tanjiro was only able to force himself out of his induced slumber by committing suicide inside his dream, something he was forced to do repeatedly during his battle with the Lower Rank, doing so instantly every time he was forced to sleep. When trapping someone inside their dreams, Enmu may enter the realm inside their minds. This dream dimension is not infinite, but circular with the dreamer at the canter and a solid wall at the edge (the wall being totally indistinguishable from farther terrain beyond it). By cutting a hole in this border, one can leave the dream and enter the subconscious of the dreamer. The subconscious reflected the individual's character, Tanjiro's subconscious for example was a beautiful endless sky, noted to feel safe and warm. In the subconscious, there is an entity known as the "Spiritual Core". Should this core be destroyed, it effectively destroys the target's mind, leaving their body as an empty shell, thus allowing Enmu to kill his victims in their dreams.
                            However, it has to be noted that there was a danger of being affected and possibly mentally changed by the unconscious mind of his victim, as seen when one of Enmu's human agents was touched by Tanjiro's inner kindness and subsequently lost his will to destroy his spiritual core. For this reason, Enmu always has someone else enter into the target's dream instead of entering it himself.

                            Whispers of Forced Unconscious Hypnosis (強きょう制せい昏こん倒とう催さい眠みんの囁ささやき Kyōsei Kontō Saimin no Sasayaki?)[13] - Enmu forms a mouth on the back of his hand which, upon saying "Go to sleep", forces the target into deep sleep instantly. This technique can be used multiple times in quick succession.

                            Eyes of Forced Unconscious Sleep (強きょう制せい昏こん倒とう睡すい眠みん・眼まなこき Kyōsei Kontō Suimin - Manakoki?) - When fused with the Mugen Train, Enmu creates dozens, or even hundreds, of eyes within his flesh, each of which has the kanji for Dream (夢ゆめ Yume?) engraved on their irises, and, upon looking into them, the target instantly falls asleep. Because the multitude of eyes all surround a target, Enmu can continually put them to sleep even when they manage to wake up, leaving them helplessly trapped. However, one downside to this technique is Enmu needs to make direct eye contact with a target to put them to sleep, as proven when Inosuke remained awake due to his mask hiding his line of sight, preventing Enmu from affecting him.

                            <b>Bone Awl:</b> Enmu could create an awl with the handle made with one of his bones and the sharp point made from one of his teeth. Enmu's awls were capable of piercing and destroying the spiritual core once it is found within the subconscious realm of a person's dream. They are more powerful than a normal tool as it was able to pierce Tanjiro's Demon Slayer Corps uniform, despite the uniform being resistant to the claws and fangs of minor demons.

                            <b>Rope:</b> In addition to the awls, Enmu also provided his agents with a special rope made of his flesh. When one end was tied to the wrist of Enmu's agent and the other end tied to the wrist of the slumbering victim, the rope enabled them to enter the dreams of the Demon Slayers, in order to find and destroy their Spiritual Cores. For unknown reasons, Tanjiro's instincts told him not to cut the ropes with his sword; instead, he had Nezuko use her Blood Demon Art to burn them.
